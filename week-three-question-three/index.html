                        <p>Just this.</p>
                        <p>I wanted to make this site look as nice as I could afford time for, but at the same time, I wanted the content to be useless. The inspiration for this monster stemmed from my desire for irony and humor, since I wanted to really enjoy myself while going through these challenges.</p>
                        <p>Also, as I researched more about Flexbox and CSS Grid, apparently Flexbox takes a content-first approach while CSS Grid takes a layout-first approach. Since the base for this page is CSS Grid, I wanted to have as little of my content planned out and as much of the layout perfercted. Hence, this abomination.</p>
                        <p>I wanted to make this website responsively designed, but alas, I ran out of time. Apologies for that one, mobile users.</p>
